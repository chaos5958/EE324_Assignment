Communication between a single client and a single server

1. How to run the program 

1) Complile - make command

2) Server-side
./PA-server [port]

3) Client-side
./PA-client [host] [port]

....
type a command: 0x003~0x005
....
(if the command is 0x003)
type a file name: [file name]
....


2. Additional explanation

In server, I used linked list to save data come from a client in the memory.

struct recv_data{
    char *data;
   struct recv_data *next_data
} 

3. Remained problem to handle

Somtimes, '\n' is missed while transmitting a text file. 
However, I haven't solved it yet.
