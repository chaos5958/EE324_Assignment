1. name: Yeo Hyun Ho
2. studentID: 20120597
3. assignment number: 2
4. collaborator: none
5. time: >10h
6. suggestion: I think chacing is one of the most imporat features in the proxy.
               If the assignment is more focused in it, it will be more interesting.
7. extra work: I implemented "caching" following the percept2 resource	    
               It was really hard to implement using fork, 
	       because forked child process doesn't share memory with parent.
	       Therefore, I use file(FILE*) to communicate with parent process.
